- Have a ModelManager class to handle operations on a model. That way, we would use self.model_manager.some_function as opposed to self.model.some_function.
- Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words. Examples include MAX_OVERFLOW and TOTAL.
